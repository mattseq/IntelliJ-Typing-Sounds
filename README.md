# IntelliJ-Typing-Sounds

Typing sounds for IntelliJ IDE, similar to Opera GX.
Personally I feel like having some sort of sound trigger on keypress is helping me focus and stay active when coding.

### Features

- Sound on Enter, Back & Typing
- No sound on CTRL + S (Multiple Keypresses).
- No Delay on Back / Enter for better sound quality
- Delay on typing for better feel and better sync with fast typers. Slow typers won't notice this.
